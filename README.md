Scheduling classes in a school

This project solves a (simple but tedious) scheduling problem. Consider a schedule for a small school consisting only of Grade 7, Grade 8, and Grade 9. The layout of the schedule is Monday to Friday with 4 periods a day. Each grade must have the correct number of periods of each course per week, as listed below. Each subject has a different teacher, except for French and Geography which are taught by the same teacher.

Number of periods for each grade:

- Math:	  4 periods
- English:		4 periods
- French:		5 periods
- Geography:		2 periods
- Art:		2 periods
- Music:		3 periods

Rules:
1)	No course must be scheduled more than once a day for any grade.
2)	No teacher is allowed to have more than 3 periods on any day.
3)	All three grades must have their French periods scheduled at the same time because they are doing a conference class with the French teacher. (One teacher teaching 3 grades at the same time for each of the periods.)
4)	The Geography teacher is the same person as the French teacher.
5)	The Math teacher needs 1 day off.
6)	The English teacher needs 1 day off.
7)	The Art teacher needs 2 days off.
8)	The Music teacher needs 1 day off.
9)	BONUS: try to minimize the number of spare periods that the teachers have.  For example, if a teacher teaches period 2 and period 4 on a given day, there is a spare period in period 3 (but not period 1, because the teacher can come to school for period 2).
